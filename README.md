# number-chain
A number chain created in PHP which outputs three conditions. 

If the number string contains a multiple of 3, it should display an "X" instead of the respective number.

If the number string contains a multiple of 5, it should display a "Y" instead of the respective number.

If both conditions apply, "XY" should be played.
